Decimal-to-Arbritrary-Base-Converter
==========================

The following C source code is my own to convert a decimal number into an equivalent string of base (0 - 36). We can only do bases
up to this much as our constraint is that states for digits are limited to digits [0:9] and characters [a,z]. This kind of problem
is a popular problem with programming interviews and hence why the source code was written. NOTE!!! Source code may have
some errors.
